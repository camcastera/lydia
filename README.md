# LYDIA algorithm

This is the Python code for the **LYDIA algorithm** introduced in the paper [Near-optimal Closed-loop Method via Lyapunov Damping for Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10053).

*Python 3.8.10*

The algorithm is available in two forms:   
  * a PyTorch optimizer to use in the same fashion as the usual [PyTorch optimizers](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) 
  * a Python function (relying on either [numpy](https://github.com/camcastera/lydia/tree/master/Numpy) or [PyTorch](https://github.com/camcastera/lydia/tree/master/Pytorch)).
